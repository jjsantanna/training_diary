Today is the forth day of training. My watch says that I MUST REST! I decide to do at least the warm up with TCT members. The trainer arrived later because it was raining. The group is young more or less the same age as me. The workout is tough 3x(2x200Z5+30'' + 4x400Z4+60'')+800Z3
I didn't train. I was only talking with the trainer and then came home.
My shin hurts. My shoulder hurts. Both are okeyish.
