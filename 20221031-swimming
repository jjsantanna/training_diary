Today was my first training related to triathlon. Today was swimming! Holy shit. I have so much to learn. There were like 50 atlets. I was definitely the worst. I couldn't make 50meters without stopping. No shame.
I've practiced several things:
- breathing with the head touching the shoulder. Arm completely extended. Diving left arm not to fast
- arm enters with shoulder space
- legs doesn't kick but nicely dance beginning with the "coxa", not too fast. Drill holding the board
- drill board at the knee. SHIT! 
I've drunk liters of water trying to breath correctly and not moving my head up. Failed miserably 

Next day. Surprinsingly, my resting HR didn't go up. It was still 68 bpm (that is high but not too high for my standards). I definitely need more rest.
